# Notion cookbook

A collection of guides, examples, and resources for building with Notion's developer platform.

This repository is a community hub for learning how to build with Notion, whether you're using the API, MCP, or other tools in the ecosystem. You'll find working code examples, AI skills, and references to help you get started.

## What's inside

### Examples

Ready-to-run code samples showing how to integrate with Notion's API:

- **[JavaScript examples](examples/javascript/)**: Integrations built with Notion's official JavaScript SDK, from basic API calls to full web applications

Future additions will include examples for other languages and frameworks.

### Skills

AI-powered workflows for common Notion tasks:

- **[Claude skills](skills/claude/)**: Skills that use Claude with Notion MCP to automate documentation, meeting prep, research, and more

As the AI ecosystem grows, we'll add skills for other providers.

### Claude Code plugin

A one-click install plugin for Claude Code users:

- **[Notion Workspace Plugin](claude-code-notion-plugin/)**: Bundles Notion Skills and the Notion MCP server together for easy installation in Claude Code

### Documentation

The `docs/` directory is reserved for Notion's core developer documentation, which will be migrated here in the future. For now, visit [developers.notion.com](https://developers.notion.com) for API references and guides.

## Getting started

### Running examples

Each example includes its own README with setup instructions. In general:

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the example you want to try
3. Install dependencies with `npm install`
4. Follow the example's README for configuration and usage

### Using skills

Skills are designed to work with Claude and the Notion MCP server. See the [skills documentation](skills/README.md) for setup instructions.
